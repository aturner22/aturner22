Background in statistics, machine learning, climate science and finance, with experience spanning both academic research and business applications.

I'm a PhD student at Imperial College London researching statistics and machine learning applied to weather prediction systems as part of the [Mathematics for Future Climate CDT](https://mfccdt.ac.uk/).

My professional experience includes data engineering and financial research roles in the financial sector, with particular expertise in forecasting, LLM implementation and unstructured data extraction. I'm available for [technical consulting](/technical_consulting/) on data-driven projects.

Recent achievements include first place wins in two [Society for Technological Advancement](https://ilikethefuture.com/) hackathons, where I developed an automated Bayesian prior elicitation system for non-technical experts and an AI geoengineering simulator based on machine learning weather models.

My previous studies include a BA in Economics and Management at the University of Oxford and an MSc in Statistics at Imperial College London. MSc thesis: *["Approximate Bayesian Computation with Proper Scoring Rules: An Inference Framework for Calibrated Probabilistic Forecasts"](/MSc_Thesis.pdf)*

Beyond work and academia, I'm a saxophonist who writes music and regularly performs across London. I also enjoy hiking, travelling and generally exploring nature!
